## How To Use The App

The App is designed to help people, and get help, using locations & places.
When using the app you have to login in order to get to the main views.

## Working Logic

Email & Password are used to login to Google’s Firebase.
The app consists of three tabs, one displays the question in the user’s area, which are ordered by Score.
A user can  view the question and add suggestions, thus he will get 10 points for each suggestions. However, that score will be divided by the weeks passed from his/her last answer, so the more you are active, the more you could get higher score & the more your questions have a chance to appear at the first rows.

### The Different Views
The second tab is for asking the question.
The third just list the user’s questions and the answers on them.
